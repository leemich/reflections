When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others or if I need to acess my files from another device.

#2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have made changes to your local repo that are incompatible with commits in the remote repo.

#3 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is created when you clone an existing GitHub user's repo to your own GitHub account.

A clone is a copy of a repo that can either be downloaded from GitHub or another computer.

A branch is created within an existing repo and allows you to make commits without affecting other branches.

You use fork when you want to copy another GitHub user's repo without having to clone it, set a remote, and push it back ot GitHub. It also links directly to the creator's original repo, making it easy to give the creator credit and recommend changes to them, if applicable.

You use clone when you want to create a local  copy of a remote repository. This could be a copy of a repo you created yourself on GitHub or it could be a copy of a repo located somewhere else on your local machine.

You use branches when you want to work on an issue separately from other branches in the same repository.

#4 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If changes are made to the same file by you locally and by someone else who pushes those changes to the remote, you can examine the differences before changing your local copy of the remote repo.
