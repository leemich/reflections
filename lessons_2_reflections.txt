What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?

It creates an empty repository and adds all relevant meta 
data in a hidden directory called .git. You need to do it so 
that you can begin tracking your changes.

#2 How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think it 
offers?

The staging area is a like a temporary holding tank where you 
can place files that you think you would like to commit 
without actually committing them.  Neither the working 
directory or the repository is changed.

I think it's valuable because it gives you a chance to change 
your mind before actually committing,  in case youo decide to 
change something else.
